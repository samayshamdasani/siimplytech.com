<h1>About</h1>
<p>siimplytech was founded with one goal: to immerse readers into the vast world of technology. Built and maintained by technology enthusiasts on the cutting edge, we promise to deliver high-quality content in a siimple fashion. </p>

<p>siimplytech.com launched in August 2016. With so many other tech blogs out there, we wanted to be <i>different</i>. That's why we've been focusing entirely on the content that you would actually want to read. Spanning from news, reviews, emerging tech, and how-to's, siimplytech is a site that you'll definitely want to check regularly.
