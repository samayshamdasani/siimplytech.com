    <p>Sci-Fi is quickly merging with what we currently know as reality. Pokemon Go, despite its extreme drop in users, has proven that augmented reality is the next best thing. Now what about virtual reality? First, we have to distinguish the two. Augmented reality is the convergence of computer simulated objects and concepts with the real world, while virtual reality is entirely computer simulated. While they both have their benefits, it’s time to talk about virtual reality.</p>

<p>Virtual reality has been steadily on the rise, coming out of the lab and into the homes of everyday individuals like you and I. Oculus Rift is one of these products that place virtual reality in the hands of anyone willing to spend the money to obtain the surreal experience. Oculus Rift is primarily known amongst gamers, looking for the ultimate experience to submerse themselves in the gameplay as much as possible without subjecting their physical bodies to the harm. But VR is capable of much more, and this article will go in depth into the vital implementations virtual reality has.</p>

<p>Becoming exponentially popular, VR headsets are becoming cheaper and more compatible. What do I mean by this? Well take Samsung for example; they quickly capitalized on the mainstream attention virtual reality has been getting and introduced a headset that is directly compatible with galaxy phones, giving any person with a galaxy phone and this headset to experience VR anywhere, anytime. Special cameras even allow studios to create videos that can be viewed in full 360, enhancing the experience with the submersive headset. American Horror Story has recently done this in a graphic version as promotion for it’s upcoming 6th season.</p>

<p>Now let’s get serious here, what are the most important uses virtual reality has to offer to the world? The answer is quite simple actually, and it is: The power of learning from experience. I’m pretty sure you’ve heard countless times that you can be taught something a thousand times but the true learning is done through experience, and that is undoubtedly true. Let’s take the medical field for example. More specifically, surgeons (you’ve probably seen that coming). This medical field is primarily learned and taught effectively through kinesthetics, learning through the physical act of doing. Now colleges can’t just go having students practice on someone with a beating heart for obvious reasons. So what’s the next best thing? VR.</p>

<div class="video-container"><iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n7ALZkPoTYQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p><br />
As the video above shows, student can get a more in depth experience of the surgical process in the real world without even having to leave the classroom. This can even be done at home, so the limitations are reduced to none. With the production of even more advanced VR in the making, you can expect more interactive platforms where motions sensors will be utilize to accurately detect motion and simulate movement to give the user an even deeper feel for the virtual task at hand.</p>

<p>Besides producing better, and more experienced surgeons straight out of school, VR can help pilots in their training, simulating emergency events and placing the trainee in situations they may encounter someday in their careers where hundreds of lives will be in their hands. It can also help soldiers train in combat, and help astronauts prep for space exploration more effectively.</p>

<p>While Pokemon Go may have been a fad amongst most, augmented and virtual reality is here to not only stay, but to improve, and improve the lives of billions of people around the world.</p>
