    <p>Electric cars have taken the world’s attention by storm. We’ve all have seen an electric car on the road at some point in our lives and you may wonder: how come these vehicles are becoming so popular? I’m here to help you understand what electric cars truly do for us globally.</p>

<p class="quote">“We will not stop until every car on the road is electric.”- <b><i>Elon Musk</i></b></p>

<p>This makes Elon Musk well, as determined as he possibly could be, but this isn’t about him, this is about the future of cars, specifically, <i> electric </i> cars. An electric car is simply a vehicle that runs on at least one electric motor, and the energy comes from the controller which controls the overall amount of power being used.</p>

<p>How can electric cars make your life more convenient than a NGS (natural gas vehicle)? Well, you can charge the battery of your EV almost anywhere now. Japan now has more <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/10/japan-electric-car-charge-points-petrol-station">EV charging ports</a> than gas stations which is quite astonishing if you ask me, and not only that, but Japan’s travel cost has reduced by 89%. Cars like the <a href="https://www.tesla.com/models">Tesla Model S</a> give up to 219 miles off a full charge on the base model.</p>

<p>Another great feature about EV’s are that they release no tailpipe emissions. As a result, this prevents global warming as it provides efficient air quality while significantly reducing oil consumption.</p>

<p>However, there is that downside of EV’s being charged by coal-fired power, although this is still much cleaner than vehicles that run on gas. Who knows, soon the electric system will incorporate solar, wind, and other forms of energy which will make these vehicles more sustainable overall. In fact, Tesla recently acquired <a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-and-solarcity-combine">SolarCity</a> which proves that Tesla may have plans to incorporate solar-powered batteries in their upcoming cars.</p>

<p>If you love driving, you know that the best part is the ultimate experience. Electric cars make it vital to provide the driver with the best driving possible. They are quick, quiet, and due to the high amount of torque, electric cars are a pleasure to ride and drive.</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>Of course, the most popular electric car is the Model S. I’ve embedded a video that explains the in-n-outs of the car.</p>

<p>Although electric vehicles are great, people struggle to obtain these cars due to its pricing. EVs can range between $30,000-$980,000. Don’t worry though, you as a consumer will love to hear that companies are in development of more affordable vehicles like the <a href="https://www.tesla.com/model3">Tesla Model 3</a>, an electric car aimed for everyone.</p>

<p>Another huge downside in owning an electric car is the time it takes for it to charge. You’ll have to time your day effectively. To solve this, charging stations like the <a href="https://www.tesla.com/supercharger">Tesla Supercharger</a> are showing up more frequently all over the world, however, you must still take this into account when driving your car. It can handle your daily commute and errands just fine, but, however, if you’re planning on driving across the country for instance, I suggest you find EV stations before hand or have a backup battery. In addition, an upgrade to a hybrid car may be more ideal for those types of drivers.</p>

<p>In 2014, there were about 405,000 electric vehicles being used, and you may think that is certainly a lot, well, in 2016, the world has about 1.3 million electric vehicles on the road, and that my friend, is quite a number.</p>
