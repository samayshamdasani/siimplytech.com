    <p>Just the other day, several reports were published that Uber made a <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/8/25/12647814/uber-loss-billion-2016-travis-kalanick-lyft">loss</a> of $1.27 billion in the first half of 2016, or $6.5 million dollars a day. Yep, that’s no typo.</p>

<p>The report of Uber’s massive losses don’t add up to a lot of people, including myself. Shouldn’t Uber be turning a profit since all it does is run an app that connects people with rides? Shouldn’t the 25% cut from every ride be enough?</p>

<p>Well, let’s talk competitors. In the same space, we have Lyft all over the US, and other ride-sharing companies like Gett and Juno in NYC. Uber’s trying their best to crush them out of every market, and they’re ready to spend a pretty hefty amount giving out free rides, promo codes, and lower fares for customers - which is why, on some rides, Uber’s losing money.</p>

<p>Using those promotions, Uber has able to expand rapidly in search for customer loyalty. However, customers will most likely lean towards the service that’s cheaper, and as a result, drivers will lean towards the service which has the most customers.</p>

<p>Also, since Uber isn’t public yet, it’s still depending on funding like any other startup.</p>

<p class="quote">"The <i>only</i> reason why Uber is sustainable today is because of funding from companies, banks, and VC's."</p>

<p>Another place where Uber’s spending is R&amp;D. Just two-weeks ago, Uber bought <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/sarwantsingh/2016/08/24/uber-acquiring-otto-could-be-the-lead-domino-autonomous-vehicles-to-spur-ma-activity/#1dca796665ae">Otto</a>, a autonomous truck driving company for $680 million. That <i> is </i> a lot of money, but Uber believes it’ll be beneficial to them in the long term. Uber’s business model eventually will be to cut the driver out completely, and take 100% of the fare paid by customers.</p>

<p class="quote">"Uber's ready to get rid of the middle-man."</p>

<p>Even Amazon couldn’t keep up with their low price tags and overheads, which really never made them profitable until <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/07/hey-look-amazon-actually-turned-profit/">recently</a>. In fact, the most Amazon ever lost was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/02/business/amazing-amazon-losses-grow-as-they-seem-to-shrink.html">$1.4 billion</a> back in 2000, and they’re running a business with goods being shipped everyday, not a service-based company like Uber.</p>

<p>Will these losses be worth it in the long term? Maybe. If Uber can innovate and deliver a reliable, safe, and cheap self-driving taxi, then sure, then it’s worth it. However, the fact that even Lyft is losing as much as <a href="http://www.siliconbeat.com/2016/07/12/lyft-losing-much-50-million-month-president-confirms/">$50 million</a> a month proves that this is a really tough business to be in.</p>

<p>Uber’s trying to become the world’s first worldwide ride-sharing based taxi network. Operating in 76 countries, it’s valued at $62.5 billion dollars. Right now, Uber’s mission is to develop the first self-driving taxi service, but it’ll still be a couple years till we see autonomous vehicles driving around with an Uber sticker.</p>
