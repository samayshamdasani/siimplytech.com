<h1 class="post-headings">Apple Watch Series 2</h1>
<p>The next generation of Apple Watch is swim-proof and is rated water resistant for up to 50 meters. For it’s speaker’s to work, Apple was able to re-engineer the Watch to eject the water out to produce sound. They also claimed that they’ve tested the water resistance in a simulation for over 100,000 swimming strokes to make sure that it’s truly durable.</p>

<p>It also has a dual core processor and a GPU that’s over two times faster than the first Apple Watch. To show off this tech, Apple demoed an app, Night Sky, running at over 60fps. It also has a brand new display that’s twice as bright at 1,000 nits.</p>

<p>In addition, Apple Watch Series 2 has built in GPS for walking and running with pace, distance, and a route map. Apple’s also worked with Nike to announce Apple Watch Nike+. It’s specifically designed for runner’s in mind with built in Nike running features.</p>

<p>As far as hardware goes, Apple Watch Series 2 now comes in a ceramic body and Hermes leather bands.</p>

<p>All versions of Apple Watch Series 2 will be priced at $369. Apple’s added the dual core processor to the first generation Apple Watch and it’ll be available for $269.</p>

<h1 class="post-headings">iPhone 7</h1>
<p>It’s time for what we’re all waiting for, the iPhone 7. Apple’s sold over 1,000,000,000 phones. Yep, that’s nine zeros. 1 billion.</p>

<p class="quote">"iPhone: Best selling product of its kind in the history of the world." - <b><i> Tim Cook</i> </b></p>

<p>Apple’s most advanced phone to-date has 10 new major features:
<br /><br /></p>
<ol>
  <li>Design: Jet Black &amp; Black colors.
<br /><br /></li>
  <li>Home Button: Force sensitive, solid state.
<br /><br /></li>
  <li>Water and Dust Resistant: IP67 protection standard
<br /><br /></li>
  <li>Camera: Both versions of the iPhone will have optical image stabilization, a wider f/1.8 aperture lens, &amp; a high-speed 12 megapixel sensor. 50% more light w/ flash. Front-facing Facetime HD camera has a 7 megapixel sensor. However, the iPhone 7 Plus has <b> two </b> high-speed 12 megapixel cameras. This could be used for zoom while maintaining image quality. In addition, the new cameras on the 7 Plus has the ability to take shallow depth-of-field to allow for beautiful, bokehilious photos.
<br /><br /></li>
  <li>Retina HD Display: 25% brighter.
<br /><br /></li>
  <li>Stereo Speakers: One on the bottom, another up top. Twice the volume as before.
<br /><br /></li>
  <li>Lightning Earpods: because Apple removed the headphone jack.
<br /><br /></li>
  <li>Apple Airpods: Wireless Earphones using the W1 chip. Infared sensors detect when they are in your ear. Have a wireless charging case. External microphones.
<br /><br /></li>
  <li>Apple Pay: More International capability.
<br /><br /></li>
  <li>Performance: 64-bit A10 Fusion chip. Four cores. Two cores over 2x faster than the A9 chip. Two more low-performance chips for boosts in performance. On average, Apple says you’ll get about two more hours of battery life on the 7.
<br /></li>
</ol>
<p class="quote">"The CPU and GPU are over 120x and 240x faster than the original iPhone."</p>

<p>The iPhone is available in Silver, Rose Gold, Black, and Jet Black at 32GB, 128GB, and 256GB configurations. iPhone 7 starts at $649. Pre-orders start Friday, September 9th and it’s starts shipping on September 16th, 2016.</p>
