    <p>Apple’s recent release of the iPhone 7 just took place on the 7th of September. Lucky number 7? Not so much. Although the release of the apple’s newest product received as much attention as any other release in the product line, the attention wasn’t all positive, and for reasons you would know about (if you don’t live under a rock).</p>

<p>With updates including a new Jet Black color, upgraded cameras, and water resistance, one of the more controversial things Apple has done is remove the headphone jack from all iPhone 7 models. While some individuals like the move, many are still unable to adapt to this change. Wireless may sound nice, but throw in the word battery life and it changes everything. I myself, own a pair of wireless bluetooth headphones from Sony but I often carry around my wired headphones because I never know when they’ll die. This is the problem iPhone 7 users will have to face, but with the added struggle of not having that audio jack available.</p>

<p class="quote">“Necessity spawns opportunity.”</p>

<p>If that phrase doesn’t have any significant meaning to you yet, it will in a few short moments. So, one of the primary questions asked regarding the removed audio jack is: “How will I use my headphones that require an audio port?”. Many people have wired headphones from Beats by Dr. Dre, <a href="https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2014/05/28Apple-to-Acquire-Beats-Music-Beats-Electronics.html">which is ironic because Apple acquired in 2014</a>, and of course, many people would want to continue using their beloved high quality headset. What would happen to all of those customers? The answer is a dongle.</p>

<p>Apple has announced they are planning to release a <a href="http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMX62AM/A/lightning-to-35-mm-headphone-jack-adapter">dongle</a> that will do convert the lightning port to a 3.5mm audio jack, as well as offer a splitter with open charging port alongside it for those that want to listen to music and charge their phones simultaneously for about $40.</p>

<p>Going back to the quote, “necessity spawns opportunity”, we all know how expensive Apple likes to make their accessories, and the iPhone 7 seems to require a lot of them to be a complete phone. Just imagine losing one headphone piece. Apple can sell you another individual piece, and seeing that the pair cost up to $159, we can assume that the individual piece will be around $80. Yup…Apple has truly lost their minds.</p>

<p>Knowing that almost nobody will be happy to pay those prices for Apple’s products, third party manufacturers will step in as always, but this time, they will be more successful than ever as they can offer products such as the dongle significantly cheaper. As far as the Airpods go, it may be a ways before any unauthorized company may figure out how to rip them off with that type of technology, but when they do, the tech giant known as Apple will be forced to re-evaluate their prices design for the next iPhone release.</p>
