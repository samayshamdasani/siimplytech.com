The thought of having **just a browser** on your computer may feel a little limiting, but for many, that's really all they need. That's exactly what Google is trying to spread with it's operating system, Chrome OS. Initially announced in 2009, Chrome OS is gaining traction, especially in education, where schools are jumping on the opportunity to provide students with affordable internet-connected devices with simple word-processing functionality. Often costing less than $300 with about 16GB of physical storage, Google is aiming for a market that can serve almost everyone except businesses and professionals.

Since Google is targeting so many people, there's no doubt that Microsoft is scared. More people are switching from Windows PCs to Chromebooks than ever before, and manufacturers are too. In addition, Google does not charge any licensing fees like Microsoft does with Windows. This makes it ideal for manufacturers to produce Chrome OS laptops so that they too, can jump into the booming demand.

But, why is Google offering it's OS to manufacturers for free? The fact is, that Chrome OS is indirectly making them millions. Once you buy a Chromebook, you are essentially commiting to Google's ecosystem. That means you will mostly use Gmail, Google Drive, Google Photos, and so on.

In addition, Google has announced that the play store will be coming to [chromebooks](https://chrome.googleblog.com/2016/05/the-google-play-store-coming-to.html). This means that Chromebook owners can download and use Android apps from the most popular app store in the world. Chromebook owners will be able to actually play minecraft, or even make a skype call right from their computer. Google is showing that Chromebooks are not much different from PCs and Macs.

With new [reports](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/23/chromebook-mac-google-pc-sales) stating that Chromebooks are outselling Macs, it's already proven that people are noticing that a web browser is really all they need - and the many years of Google's efforts to ahieve that have finally paid off. The appeal of Chromebooks are broadening, and I'm sure they will for years to come.
