Just the other day, several reports were published that Uber made a [loss](http://www.theverge.com/2016/8/25/12647814/uber-loss-billion-2016-travis-kalanick-lyft) of $1.27 billion in the first half of 2016, or $6.5 million dollars a day. Yep, that's no typo.

The report of Uber's massive losses don't add up to a lot of people, including myself. Shouldn't Uber be turning a profit since all it does is run an app that connects people with rides? Shouldn't the 25% cut from every ride be enough?

Well, let's talk competitors. In the same space, we have Lyft all over the US, and other ride-sharing companies like Gett and Juno in NYC. Uber's trying their best to crush them out of every market, and they're ready to spend a pretty hefty amount giving out free rides, promo codes, and lower fares for customers - which is why, on some rides, Uber's losing money.

Using those promotions, Uber has able to expand rapidly in search for customer loyalty. However, customers will most likely lean towards the service that's cheaper, and as a result, drivers will lean towards the service which has the most customers.

Also, since Uber isn't public yet, it's still depending on funding like any other startup.

Another place where Uber's spending is R&D. Just two-weeks ago, Uber bought [Otto](http://www.forbes.com/sites/sarwantsingh/2016/08/24/uber-acquiring-otto-could-be-the-lead-domino-autonomous-vehicles-to-spur-ma-activity/#1dca796665ae), a autonomous truck driving company for $680 million. That <i> is </i> a lot of money, but Uber believes it'll be beneficial to them in the long term. Uber's business model eventually will be to cut the driver out completely, and take 100% of the fare paid by customers.

<p class="quote">"Uber's ready to get rid of the middle-man."</p>

Even Amazon couldn't keep up with their low price tags and overheads, which really never made them profitable until [recently](http://www.wired.com/2015/07/hey-look-amazon-actually-turned-profit/). In fact, the most Amazon ever lost was [$1.4 billion](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/02/business/amazing-amazon-losses-grow-as-they-seem-to-shrink.html) back in 2000, and they're running a business with goods being shipped everyday, not a service-based company like Uber.

Will these losses be worth it in the long term? Maybe. If Uber can innovate and deliver a reliable, safe, and cheap self-driving taxi, then sure, then it's worth it. However, the fact that even Lyft is losing as much as [$50 million](http://www.siliconbeat.com/2016/07/12/lyft-losing-much-50-million-month-president-confirms/) a month proves that this is a really tough business to be in.

Uber's trying to become the world's first worldwide ride-sharing based taxi network. Operating in 76 countries, it's valued at $62.5 billion dollars. Right now, Uber's mission is to develop the first self-driving taxi service, but it'll still be a couple years till we see autonomous vehicles driving around with an Uber sticker.
