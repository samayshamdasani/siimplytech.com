  Pop music has changed, for better or for worse?

If one clicked on any song on the Billboard top 100, he or she would notice a few trends: rhythm; a catchy melody; and some sort of electronic input. Rhythm and melody have always been part of pop music, but synthesizers and computers have only (relatively) recently become a thing. But is it really a good thing?

The sound effects and editing of computers are so important today in pop, and I can’t imagine a contemporary world with no guidance from the logic of a computer program. Still, it seems to have become more than just guidance. Computers and synthesizers largely provide rhythm and other musical input. One could go so far as to say that the modern-day drummer is archaic. If a pop-star, like Taylor Swift, decides to put noticeable, natural-sounding percussion, it is simply a novelty, and not necessarily taken seriously. Would an average listener really notice a guitar solo if it’s only half a pre-chorus long? (No, because you don’t really hear guitar solos in pop anymore.) In a concert, does Kanye West really need a drummer? He may use one, but any computer could do. And that could be a problem.

Of course, it’s not like older popular musicians didn’t realize the advantages of technology in music. Les Paul and Mary Ford discovered the practicality of recording over recordings, and used it in obvious-sounding ways, a famous example being the song “How High the Moon.” The electric guitar itself was considered a technological advancement, and has become such a part of music culture(but now an unnecessary gimmick for some). More than a few groups starting in the 80s relied on lip syncing, although that didn’t always work out so well.

But the difference in then and now is that the music of decades past that we still remember today never relied solely on computers in rhythm and effects. Musicians and producers back then simply used it as another helpful tool in their large selection of money-making methods.

I’m not trying to say that modern music is terrible, or that we should all start listening to Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. There is just some concern as to the future of music. If the slope of computer use in pop continues to exponentially grow, then what use will “real” musicians be in a few years? Just gimmicks, maybe. How often do you hear a guitar in a pop song? How often do you hear it play more than one riff over and over again? Entire bands and artists that don’t openly use as much artificial help as others are packaged and sold as “old-fashioned”, and can’t really do anything to change their image. They provide some leverage for the “real” stars. One “old-fashioned” example is Bruno Mars. His managers have certainly crafted a retro sound in his music.

But would older pop artists like what they hear in this century? Loop after loop of electronic sound, singers whose voices are processed again and again to sound clearer, beats made by a rich man that you’ll never see (but it’s always been like that); What would Les Paul think of this? Maybe he would embrace everything about the advantages of modern music, or maybe he would find it fake, pretentious, and brutally simple.  

Next time you listen to a radio, or Spotify, or even a car commercial, just think about the music you hear. Did it take a musician to make it? Will studio musicians be replaced by simpler, “cooler” methods? Should music become more electronic?

At least it’s funny when my suburban high school’s field hockey team decides to warm up to trap music.
