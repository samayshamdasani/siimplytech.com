Starting from an online bookstore in 1994, Amazon conquered the [ecommerce market](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenkam/2016/05/27/the-market-is-underestimating-amazon/#6fa0e7397995), become [profitable](http://www.theverge.com/2016/7/28/12313526/amazon-q2-2016-earnings-report-aws-cloud-profit), and is now on it's latest ambition: delivering your packages. 

Since early 2014, Amazon's quietly been making moves in the shipping industry with opening dozens of delivery centers and programs. These deliveries come through a carrier named AMZL_US, or Amazon Logistics. 

Heading over to Amazon's official site for their delivery service, [logistics.amazon.com](https://logistics.amazon.com/), Amazon states that the delivery providers "are local companies that Amazon uses to deliver packages from a central location to our customer's door." (a third party) As soon as you click apply, it brings you to a page for a company to register itself with Amazon as a delivery partner. 

And, that's not all. Amazon's also trying to promote it's new [flex](https://flex.amazon.com/) program where individuals can deliver Amazon packages for extra cash. But, are all these efforts worth it?

Even though this might be costing Amazon a ton, all they're trying to do is gain more control of the moment you buy an item to the moment it gets to your door. The importantance of this is now Amazon is able to get packages to customers directly - without having to deal with the hassles of other carriers like UPS and FedEx. Essentially, Amazon wants to be the only one between you and your wallet. 

Judging by a couple [discussions](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/forums/ref=cs_hc_g_tv?ie=UTF8&forumID=Fx1SKFFP8U1B6N5&cdThread=Tx3FZ34YNIDMPX7) online, Amazon Logistics doesn't seem to be doing that well so far. But, that can change. It's interesting to see how a company evolves into so many other spaces that you'd never imagine they'll go into. With Amazon, they did ecommerce, they did home automation, they did cloud services, and now they're still doing all of that and trying to manage their own shipping company. 

Nevertheless, at the moment, all Amazon has are a bunch of vans with Amazon stickers - and if it becomes something more than just that, Amazon will have one more thing to throw on their list of accomplishments.
