Over the past two years, GoPro's been struggling. [2015 wasn't a great year](http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/136453-gopro-s-disastrous-fourth-quarter-leads-to-workforce-layoffs-and-more) for the company, and [2016 isn't much better](https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/27/gopro-soars-10-on-earnings-beat/). Even with numerous price cuts, GoPro still can't pull through.

<p class = "quote"> All GoPro needs is a hero.</p>

How do you save a company not doing so well? That's right. Announce a new product. This week, GoPro announced the [Karma Drone](https://shop.gopro.com/karma). It's their first attempt in this market, and they sure did enter strong. GoPro's been aiming the Karma for all people, not just athletes. Hence, they've made it <i> really easy </i> for first-time flyers to get up in the air. With auto-takeoff and landing modes, an "easy" flight mode, some autonomous features, a full-fledged touchscreen LCD controller, and about 20 min of battery life, GoPro really is delivering a serious product.

It's clear that the Karma trying to complete with one of the most popular drones on the market, the [DJI Phantom 4](http://www.dji.com/phantom-4), with an even cheaper price point at just $799. Of course, that is, if you have a GoPro to take video. Otherwise, for $799, you'd just get a really powerful quadcopter.

In addition, GoPro is also selling bundles with the Hero 5 for $1199 or $999 with the Hero 5 Session (both saving you $100 if you bought them separately).

Moving on, GoPro's newly updated Hero action cameras are great. The Hero 5 and Hero 5 Session both shoot 4k at 30 frames per second, both are water resistant up to 33 feet, and have voice control. However, in essence, they are still GoPros.

I still doubt any hobbyist videographer would upgrade from a Hero 3 or 4 considering the upgrades. GoPro's just do what they do, well.

Another source of revenue GoPro's hoping that will take off is GoPro Plus. It's a service that automatically uploads your videos and photos from your GoPro to the cloud - so that you can view, edit, and share your content easily.

In fact, GoPro Plus is a important move -- because now GoPro provides a service. In my opinion, that's really the way to go. In fact, they even have two video editing apps, [Splice and Quik](https://gopro.com/news/introducing-the-gopro-mobile-creative-suite-featuring-quik-and-splice). Even though these apps aren't the main focus of GoPro, they could be the key to their success.

<p class = "quote"> GoPro wants to make the products to help you tell your stories. </p>

If GoPro can master those editing services, boom. They've got a product they can sell to even non-GoPro users and those users will be able to get that same GoPro editing experience without buying a $400 camera. If GoPro implemented what Apple did in iOS 10 with [memories](http://appleinsider.com/articles/16/06/16/inside-ios-10-photos-memories-will-generate-slideshow-movies-automatically), GoPro could offer it's editing service to anyone. Now, being honest, after you look at your footage, do you even do anything with it half of the time? What if you could throw it into GoPro's app that automatically created an awesome video for every trip.

GoPro is certainly moving back into the right direction, and these decisions will ultimately decide their fate for years to come.
