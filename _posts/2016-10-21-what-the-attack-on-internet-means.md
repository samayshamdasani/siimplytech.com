The internet was attacked today. Well, not the <i>entire</i> internet, but a lot of the sites you use everyday were. 
But the best part is that this attack was just on one company. That company was [Dyn](https://dyn.com) and just this morning, it was hit with several DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks. But, how did a attack on some company you've never heard about disrupt your browsing sessions this morning?

Sites like Reddit, Netflix, Twitter, PayPal, Spotify, SoundCloud, GitHub and many more all were impacted because they use [Dyn's DNS service](http://dyn.com/products/). Essentially, for these websites, Dyn is the [middle-man on the internet](https://siimplytech.com/2016/10/02/how-the-internet-works-copy.html), linking your requests from your devices to the destination of the site through a Domain Name System (DNS). The attack which stroke Dyn overwhelmed the server with so many requests that it couldn't process any. Instead of taking down one site, all the sites that were linked to Dyn's DNS were taken down. This is what makes an attack like this so effective. 

According to [downdetector.com](http://downdetector.com/status/level3/map/), here's a image of the impact the attack had on the internet as a whole:

This attack is proof that it's entirely possible to take down the internet. This is perhaps one of the largest DDoS attacks we've seen, and as these attacks become more common, security is going to be a much higher concern for not only companies, but [us too](https://siimplytech.com/privacy/2016/08/25/privacy.html). Even though the group behind this attack remains a mystery, there's no doubt that today's incident will further impact the way in which the world looks toward the internet.
