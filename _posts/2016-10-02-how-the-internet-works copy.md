  Breaking down the one of the world's greatest innovations.

---
The internet is the possibly the world’s greatest innovation. Within seconds, we can send a message around the globe, stream a video, or learn something new from millions of resources.  We all love the internet, but how does it actually work?

<h4> Breaking it down, siimply </h4>

In essence, the internet is just a bunch of computers connected to each other. When you are browsing the web, you are actually just getting information from all different computers around the world.

When you connect to WiFi, you aren’t just connecting to some magical cloud. WiFi uses radio waves to transmit information to something called a <i> router</i>. That router is able to act as a hub for all your devices. But, how does this work? How does a message from New York reach Los Angeles in less than a second? Are there some sort of cables?

Yep, that’s right. They are already cables linked to your house - like your telephone line. Your <i> modem </i> converts the information requested that’s sent to your router to data manageable to telephone infrastructure. Through your telephone line, that information is then forwarded to your Internet Service Provider (ISP). An ISP manages a bunch of <i> special </i> routers that link up the world. When you search the web, your ISP carries your request through the network of ISP networks to the destination network.

<h4> Connecting to computers </h4>

Now, whenever you browse the internet, you have to specify which computer you want to connect to. We do this through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. IP addresses consist of four numbers separated by a single dot. For example, ```192.30.252.153```
is an IP address. However, it’s not really easy to remember such a long series of numbers - so we use something called domain names . Domains are basically an alias of IP addresses. For example, ``` siimplytech.com``` is an alias for an IP address on the server it’s hosted on.

But, not only does the server you are connecting to have IP address - you do too. In fact, each own of your devices has it’s own IP that’s used by hosts to locate your device. The web itself is built on top of this infrastructure. It uses the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) as the foundation of data communication between you and the host.

<h4> The bottom line </h4>

The internet is just an infrastructure which allows billions of devices like your laptops, phones, and tablets to all connect to each other. In addition to the web, other services like email, FTP, and IRC are all built on top of the internet’s ever-growing infrastructure - and it’s growing faster than ever.  There are [6.4 billion](http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3165317) devices estimated to be connected to the internet as of this year - and there’s no doubt the internet will be continue to be one of the most influential technological infrastructures for years to come.
