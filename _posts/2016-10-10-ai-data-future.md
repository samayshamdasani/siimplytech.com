  The more we learn about artificial intelligence, the more we learn about ourselves, and that's just as powerful as recreating man.

Artificial Intelligence has recently become a topic of serious discussion in the tech community. Some are for it, seeing the potential for societal growth and innovation through it exploitation, while some see its development as a threat to society, building a conscious being that’s void of emotion and any sense of ethicality, or acs an unethical practice in itself, believing that constructing a being is the work of god and should be left to a higher power. However, there is a great potential to better the world with the use of artificially intelligent programs. 

Data is an abstract concept to many, but it has a definite presence today, and always has since the dawn of man. Data is simply any recorded information, and this is extremely powerful. A few examples of data, in evolutionary order, include cave paintings of animals, hieroglyphs documenting rituals, renaissance scientist recording results of their experiments, and now your google searches. If you didn’t already know, Google saves all of your searches...all of them. Some conspiracy theorist might attribute this to the government keeping tabs on every single thing you do, but it’s actually for a much more humane cause.

<i> How do you predict a flu outbreak weeks before it occurs? </i> Well if you’re Google, you query all searches related to the flu, and analyze that data, find a pattern, and boom! Your prediction of the coming outbreak has a solid basis. This was one of Google’s famous projects that successfully predicted the outbreak of the flu based solely on analysis of google searches related to the keyword: Flu. A big part of this project was seeing a pattern to make a valid prediction. 

Something that's extremely good at finding patterns in a big mess of data are machine learning algorithms. When Google continued to track the searches to analyze patterns in search for the next outbreak, their process was completely skewed. This was due to many people hearing about their project, resulting in a surge in flu related searches which contaminated their data. With an advanced machine learning algorithm, this could be fixed. The program could analyze the pattern of the words in the searches, and even with a contaminated surge in searches, based on frequency and taking into consideration other keywords that may suggest an unrelated search, the algorithm could weed out what searches are most likely informative, and use the searches that are most likely pointing to a possible outbreak.  

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are two different things. While machine learning uses models created by the developers to train its database of information, artificial intelligence is exactly what it’s name suggests: Intelligence that isn’t natural. Much about human intelligence is still a mystery, so replicating it is exceeding difficult, but the crux of it all is creating an artificial neural network that can function on it’s own, and build it’s own database of information the same way a human would. The bonus, however, would be it’s consciousness. You would be able to have a conversation with this 'thing' as if it were a human. 

So many questions arise about ourselves when we think about AI, for example, what does it mean to take a stance on something. If you asked an AI who would make a better president, Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. Most people make these decisions based on countless biases, both conscious and subconscious. What bias would an artificially intelligent being have to answer such a question? Are all of our decisions, as humans, made with a bias? How much of what we do is is driven by emotion?  The more we learn about artificial intelligence, the more we learn about ourselves, and that's just as powerful as recreating man.
