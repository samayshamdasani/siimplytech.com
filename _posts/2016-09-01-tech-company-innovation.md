  Are tech companies innovating enough?

As a kid, I'd always enjoy walking into a [Micro Center](http://www.microcenter.com/) or a [Best Buy](http://bestbuy.com), and playing around with the latest computers, phones, and tablets for hours exploring their new features and studying the specs. Amazed by the breakthrough technologies, I remember running to my parents and explaining to them that you can actually read your newspaper on a touch screen and that I would be able to show them if they bought me an iPod Touch. Although it wasn't a long time ago, times are changing. Back then, the touch screen was truly an innovation that several years ago no one could get over the fact that it would even exist. Today, companies <i> are </i> still innovating, but in the wrong measures.

<p class="quote">"Companies <i> are </i> innovating, but in the wrong measures."</p>

For example, for the most part, didn't companies like Apple and Samsung, in the last five years, develop a bigger, higher resolution screen, add a fingerprint sensor, improve the camera, and change the design of their mobile devices? Now I'm not saying that isn't innovation. I'm just saying that it isn't enough. Tech companies are interested in beating their <i>competition</i>, not beating their last innovation.

<p class="quote">Tech companies are interested in beating their <i>competition</i>, not beating their last <i> innovation</i>.</p>

As a result, companies like Apple and Samsung are copying their competitors' features in search for customers who are interested in them.  This limits their ability to create new, meaningful, tech that will actually have an impact on the way people use technology everyday.

<p class="quote">"<b>Innovation</b> distinguishes between a <b>leader</b> and a <b>follower</b>." - <b><i> Steve Jobs </i></b></p>

Steve Jobs knew that innovation is about creating something totally <b>different</b>, and that principal is what made Apple different. Today, I see many followers, but barely see a leader. It feels as if the innovation is lost in the depths of the numbers.

On a positive note, I'd like to talk about companies that actually are innovating in the <i>right</i> measures. Those companies innovate to create great products and services that the world can use every single day.

A clearest example of those very principles would be Google. With projects such as [Ara](https://atap.google.com/ara/), [Loon](http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/2/8129543/google-x-internet-balloon-project-loon-interview), and [Tango](https://get.google.com/tango/), Google's really showing that it can innovate in so many aspects. Other products and services like [Drive](https://drive.google.com), [Chrome OS](https://google.com/chromebook/), and Android continue to prove that Google is doing a lot for the development of the tech industry.

I'm just waiting that one day they'll be even more leaders like Google who are developing their own original ideas, as those are the very ideas that will be, hopefully, called <b>innovation</b>.
